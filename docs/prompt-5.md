Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously plan and then create a complete updated replacement PRD that combines the best of all the submitted PRDs, incorporating your suggestions which is the Hybrid approach/architecture. First think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how best to combine the best elements and ideas from all these PRDs, then meticulously create an implementation plan to create a complete updated drop-in replacement PRD. Make sure the updated PRD is as comprehensive as possible. Review and validate the implementation before proceeding cautiously to execute it.

Since the complete updated PRD is likely to be very long because it is expected to be very comprehensive, **generate your complete updated replacement PRD in two logical parts**. Now plan and generate the first half of the updated "Hybrid" PRD.
