Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please meticulously review @master_execution_plan.md together with your reference `VALIDATED_PROJECT_UNDERSTANDING.md` , then meticulously plan to create a comprehensive implementation plan ( sub-plan in other words) for Phase 5 in the `master_execution_plan.md`. Include in your Phase 5 implementation plan a list of files to create and update, and include a description of the features, interfaces and checklist for each of these files. Then review and validate the Phase 5 implementation with relevant project specification documents like the schema file. Finally present your validated sub-plan for Phase 5 for my approval before proceeding.
